## Projects

Here are some of the ongoing projects you can find in this repository:

1. **Basic  Message Server**
This project provides basic examples of TCP and UDP server implementations using Python's built-in socket library. The TCP server listens for incoming connections and receives messages, while the UDP server listens for incoming datagrams (client messages).

### Status: *Completed*

3. **SSL Commander**
SSL Commander is a Python-based server-client communication tool that provides secure and encrypted communication over SSL-encrypted sockets.          This tool allows you to send commands from a client to a server securely and receive responses while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data         transferred.
